NeonGoby Alias Analysis Checker
===============================

NeonGoby is a system for effectively detecting errors in alias analysis, one of
the most important and widely used program analysis. It currently checks alias
analyses implemented on the LLVM framework. We have used it to find 29 bugs in
two popular alias analysis implementations: data structure alias analysis
(`ds-aa`) and Andersen's alias analysis (`anders-aa`).

Building NeonGoby
-----------------

To build NeonGoby, you need to have a C++ compiler installed. It should compile
without trouble on most recent Linux or MacOS machines.

1. Download the source code of LLVM 3.0/3.1 and clang 3.0/3.1 from
   [LLVM Download Page](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html). Other version
of LLVM and clang are not guaranteed to work with NeonGoby.

2. Build LLVM and clang from source code.

```bash
cd <llvm source code root>
mv <clang source code root> tools/clang
./configure --enable-assertions --prefix=<where you want to install LLVM>
make [-j] install
```

3. Add LLVM's install directory to PATH, so that you can run LLVM commands
   (e.g., `llvm-config`) everywhere.

4. Checkout NeonGoby's source code

5. Build NeonGoby

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
./configure --prefix=`llvm-config --prefix`
make
make install
```

Using NeonGoby
----------------

Given a test program and a test workload, NeonGoby dynamically observes the
pointer addresses in the test program, and then checks these addresses against
an alias analysis for errors.

NeonGoby provides two modes to check an alias analysis: the offline mode and the
online mode. The offline mode checks more thoroughly, whereas the online mode
checks only intraprocedural alias queries. However, the offline mode has to log
information to disk, and on-disk logging can be costly. In contract, the online
mode embeds checks into the program, and does not require logging.

**Offline mode**

To check an alias analysis (say `buggyaa`) with a test program (say
`example.cpp`) using the offline
mode of NeonGoby, first compile the code into `example.bc` in LLVMâ€™s
intermediate representation (IR), and run the following three commands:

```bash
dynaa_hook_mem.py --hook-all example.bc
./example.inst
dynaa_check_aa.py --check-all example.bc <log file> buggyaa
```

The first command instruments the program for checking, and outputs the
instrumented executable as `example.inst`. The second command runs the
instrumented program, which logs information to
`/tmp/ng-<date>-<time>/pts-<pid>`. You can change the location by specifying
environment variable `LOG_DIR`. The third command checks this log against
`buggyaa` for errors.

**Online mode**

To check `buggyaa` with this test program using the online mode of NeonGoby, run
the following commands:

```bash
dynaa_insert_alias_checker.py --action-if-missed=report example buggyaa
./example.ac
```

The first command inserts alias checks into the test program. The second command
runs the program instrumented with alias checks, and reports missing aliases to
`/tmp/report-<pid>`. If you want the program to abort at the first missing
alias, change `--action-if-missed=report` to `--action-if-missed=abort` in the
first command.

**Other Utilities**

Use `dump_dump_log` to dump `.pts` files to a readable format.

```bash
dynaa_dump_log -log-file <log file>
```
